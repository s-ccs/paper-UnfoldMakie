= Statement of need

`UnfoldMakie.jl` is a Julia package for visualization of electroencephalography (EEG), with a focus on event-related potentials (ERPs), especially regression-ERPs (rERPs). It can accompany Unfold.jl @ehinger2019unfold, a toolbox for regression-ERP analysis, but is equivalently a standalone tool and independent from Unfold.jl).

In an earlier study @mikheev2024art, we asked novice and expert practitioners for insights into their ERP visualization practices, and consequently used their responses to improve UnfoldMakie.jl

UnfoldMakie.jl fills the gap as one of the only dedicated EEG visualization libraries with a focus on speed, ease of use, adaptability and detailed documentation. At the same time, it still allows explorative analysis (zooming/panning) and vector graphics with publication-ready figures. This is achieved by the modularity of Makie.jl, which allows to switch backends from (W)GLMakie.jl to CairoMakie.jl.

Anyone who works with EEG, MEG, ERP, iEEG or other time-series data is a target audience of this package.

= Functionality


UnfoldMakie.jl has the following benefits:
- Fast. Julia allows to plot complex figures fast. For instance, it is able to plot one figure with 20 topoplots in 0.7 seconds, which is x-times faster, compared to MNE / MATLAB. 
- Highly adaptable. The package is primarily based on Unfold.jl, Makie.jl and AlgebraOfGraphics.jl.
- Customable. Majority of EEG researchers preferred flexibility of coding as the most important feature of the tool. That's why we allowed users to flexibly customize different aspects of the plot. 
- Documented. Extensive documentation with many usage examples.
- Interactive. Several plots make use of Observables.jl which allows fast updating of the underlying data. Several plots already have predefined interactive features.
- Scientific colormaps by default. According to our earlier study @mikheev2024art, 40% of EEG researchers do not know about the issue of scientific color maps.

We currently support nine general EEG plot types:
  - ERP plot
  - Butterfly plot
  - Topography plots
  - Topography time series
  - ERP grid
  - ERP image
  - Channel image
  - Parallel coordinates
  - Circular topoplots

Also we support two Unfold-specific plots:
  - Design matrices
  - Spline plots

= State of the field

There are dozens of libraries for ERP visualization in Python and MATLAB. The most EEG practitioners (82%) have experience with non-visualization specific MATLAB-based tools like EEGLAB, FieldTrip, ERPLAB and Brainstorm. The Python-based MNE (41%) and commercial software Brain Vision Analyzer (22%) also showed significant usage, as well as custom scripts written in programming languages such as R, Python, Julia (42%).

Julia is faster than Python and MATLAB, however there are not many EEG/ERP visualization libraries. Currently, we could find #link("https://github.com/slopezpereyra/EEGToolkit.jl?tab=readme-ov-file")[EEGToolkit.jl], #link("https://github.com/JuliaHealth/NeuroAnalyzer.jl")[NeuroAnalyzer.jl]. However the are more focused on analysis of raw EEG data, while our package is more specialized for visualization of ERPs and rERP. Also there are #link("https://julianeuro.github.io/packages")[traces] of many abandoned projects.
